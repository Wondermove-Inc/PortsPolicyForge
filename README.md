- **eBPF Integration:** Utilize eBPF for high-performance, low-overhead network traffic management.


## Motivation

In dynamic Kubernetes environments, managing network traffic at the port level is essential for maintaining security and operational efficiency. Traditional network management tools often lack the granularity and automation needed to handle complex, evolving workloads. Port Policy Forge addresses these challenges by providing a robust, automated solution that seamlessly integrates with Kubernetes, enabling precise control over network 
ports and enhancing the overall security posture of your applications.

## RoadMap

Port Policy Forge is committed to continuous improvement and expanding its capabilities to meet the evolving needs of Kubernetes environments. Below is our development roadmap outlining upcoming features, milestones, and long-term goals:

### Phase 1: Initial Release
- **Core Port Management**
  - Implement basic port control and enforcement using eBPF.
- **Basic Monitoring Dashboard**
  - Develop an initial dashboard for real-time traffic insights and policy enforcement status.
- **Installation & Setup**
  - Provide Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests for straightforward installation.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security Features
- **Advanced Policy Rules**
  - Introduce support for more complex rules, including IP whitelisting/blacklisting and protocol-specific configurations.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Integrate RBAC to manage permissions for defining and applying port policies.
- **Automated Security Group Integration**
  - Automate the generation and application of security group configurations based on defined port policies.

### Phase 3: Scalability and Performance Optimization
- **Optimized eBPF Programs**
  - Enhance eBPF programs for better performance and reduced overhead in high-traffic environments.
- **High Availability**
  - Ensure Port Policy Forge operates reliably in large-scale, multi-node Kubernetes clusters.
- **Load Testing & Benchmarking**
  - Conduct extensive performance testing to validate scalability and efficiency under heavy network loads.

### Phase 4: User Experience and Integrations
- **Advanced Monitoring Tools**
  - Expand monitoring capabilities with detailed analytics, alerting mechanisms, and historical data visualization.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**
  - Seamlessly integrate with continuous delivery tools like Argo CD for automated deployment and policy updates.
- **Comprehensive Documentation & Tutorials**
  - Develop detailed guides, tutorials, and example use cases to help users get the most out of Port Policy Forge.

### Phase 5: Community and Ecosystem Growth
- **Plugin Architecture**
  - Develop a plugin system to allow community contributions and extend functionality.
- **Community Support Channels**
  - Establish forums, Slack channels, and regular webinars to engage with the user community.
- **CNCF Graduation**
  - Aim for CNCF certification and graduation to enhance project credibility and visibility within the cloud-native ecosystem.
